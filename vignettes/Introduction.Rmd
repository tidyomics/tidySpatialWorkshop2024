## Instructors

**Dr. Stefano Mangiola** is leading the Computational Cancer immunology group at the South Australian immunoGENomics Cancer Institute (SAiGENCI). He uses single-cell and spatial technologies to investigate the tumor microenvironment and the immune system. Beyong data production, his focus in on the integration and modelling of large-scale single-cell data resources. He is the author of `tidytranscriptiomics` and co-leads the `tidyomics` endevour.

**Dr. Luciano Martelotto** is a key figure in the field of spatial omics technology. He demonstrated his extensive expertise and significant contributions to the fields of single cell and spatial omics technology. Currently, he heads the Martelotto Lab located at the Adelaide Centre for Epigenetics and the South Australian immunoGENomics Cancer Institute (SAiGENCI). His lab is dedicated to the development and evaluation of new tools and methodologies for single cell and spatial omics.

## Workshop goals and objectives

### What you will learn

-   The basics of spatial profiling technologies
-   Analysis and manipulation of sequencing-based spatial data.
-   The basics of tidy R analyses of biological data with `tidyomics`
-   How to interface `SpatialExperiment` with tidy R manipulation and visualisation
-   Analysis and manipulation of imaging-based spatial data.

## Getting started

### Local

You can view the material at the workshop webpage

[here](https://tidyomics.github.io/tidySpatialWorkshop2024/articles/main.html).

## Workshop package installation 

If you want to install the packages and material post-workshop, the
instructions are below. The workshop is designed for R `4.4` and
Bioconductor 3.19. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Install workshop package
#install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install("tidyomics/tidySpatialWorkshop2024", dependencies = TRUE)

# In May 2024, the following packages should be installed from github repositories, to use the latest features. In case you have them pre installed, run the following command
BiocManager::install(c("lmweber/ggspavis", 
                       "stemangiola/tidySummarizedExperiment", 
                       "william-hutchison/tidySpatialExperiment", 
                       "stemangiola/tidybulk", 
                       "stemangiola/tidygate", 
                       "stemangiola/CuratedAtlasQueryR"), 
                     update = FALSE)
                     
BiocManager::install("ggcorrplot")
    
# Then build the vignettes
BiocManager::install("tidyomics/tidySpatialWorkshop2024", build_vignettes = TRUE, force=TRUE)

# To view vignette
library(tidySpatialWorkshop2024)
vignette("Introduction")
```

## Interactive execution of the vignettes

From command line, and enter the tidySpatialWorkshop2024 directory.

```
# Open the command line
git clone git@github.com:tidyomics/tidySpatialWorkshop2024.git

```

Alternatively download the [git zipped package](https://github.com/tidyomics/tidySpatialWorkshop2024/archive/refs/heads/devel.zip). Uncompress it. And enter the directory.
